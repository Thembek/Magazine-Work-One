                        I had just come out of a 6 months work-readiness with E.O.H and Proserv. Younglings Africa was my place
                        of internship, and, WOW! An experience, and opportunity I hope to never forget.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div className="pg42-txt-cntnt">
                    <p>
                        Coming onto Younglings, I've been challanged with a lot of obstacles. One of those obstacles being, buidling an
                        online portfolio using, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Firebase, NodeJs, Nodemailer and also having to upload the project onto Github.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        These are languages, platforms, and frameworks I had never used before, let alone heard of.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        This experienced helped broaden up my perspective on Information Technology/ Software Engineering entirely.
                        The level of experience, and work ethic one had to adapt to felt, and at the time seemed enormous to challenge head on. But, thanks to persistance,
                        and a helping hand when needed, I was able to push through.
