                    I entered the hackathon to challenge myself. The results were not to my level of expectation, 
                    the site was incomplete.

                    I used HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Firebase, Google Maps (which was not function as well as it was suppose to be).
                    A ChatBot, which had a limited amount of phrases or sentences it could stated, or said. Dependent on what the end-user
                    had to type out, or inquire.
