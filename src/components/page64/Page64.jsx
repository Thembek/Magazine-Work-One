                        During the month of January 2022, the second week after the December month leave/holidays. 
                        We as the Younglings Africa Software engineers were given a 2 weeks coding challenge 
                        by our Younglings Fearless Leaders .
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        This challenge consisted of 4 topics, one of which was, 'Build a tribute website about your favorite cartoon character.' which was the topic I happen to have chose.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Thus, this website is a tribute to our hero, Optimus Prime. Leader of the Autobots, a group of autonomous robotic organisms from the planet Cybertron.
